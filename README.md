LOVE CALCULATOR 
A program that calculates the compatibility of soul mates or people in a relationship.

TEAM:
Len Ocran: 
will be writing the backend code and the front end code, actually will be doing everything.
I will be doing all those roles because I am the only person in my Team.

TECHNOLOGIES:
Languages: Python 
Libraries and frameworks: Flask, Requests
Resources: mainly google and chatgpt
Django too can be used for this project but I prefer flask since it’s lightweight and gives me more control of my work and it’s suitable for a small project like mine

CHALLENGE:
The project intends to be a fun way of checking the compatibility of people in a relationship. It’s not intended to be a foolproof method to see if you are compatible with your partner.
The project will not solve your relationship problems and it’s not a foolproof method 
The project can help any user of any demograph, age, religion and sexual orientation.
It’s not dependent on a specific locale.

RISKS:
The is a risk for miscalculation by the program and might not give you the actual expected result.one safeguard I will be using it to make the code more robust for minimal errors 


INFRASTRUCTURE:
Branching and Merging:
We follow the Git Flow branching model, utilizing main, develop, and feature branches.
Feature branches are created for each new feature or bug fix, providing a clear isolation of changes.
Pull requests are used for code reviews before merging into the develop branch.
Release branches are created when preparing for a new version, ensuring stability.
Merging into the main branch is performed only after thorough testing and approval.
Deployment Strategy:
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented for automated testing and deployment.
The main branch triggers automatic deployment to staging for final testing.
Deployment to production is a manual process, ensuring a controlled release.
Rollback procedures are in place to quickly revert to a stable version in case of issues post-deployment.
Data Population
For production, a combination of database migrations and scripts is employed to ensure data consistency and integrity.
Regular backups are scheduled to prevent data loss and facilitate disaster recovery.
Testing Tools and Automation:
Unit tests and doctest will implemented to ensure code reliability.
EXISTING SOLUTION:
I do not know if existing or similar project
